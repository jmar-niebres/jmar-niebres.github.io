My most embarrassing experience is when I rode in Surfdance and I shouted very loud to the point that all the people are staring at time.
<P>
Also, when we went to enchanted kingdom me and my friends rode at space shuttle and when I went back down, I vomited and everyone was staring at me 
so that is the most embarrassing experience.
